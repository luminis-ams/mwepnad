# Sample code for the M-WePNaD task

The abovementioned task addresses Multilingual Web Person Name Disambiguation
(M-WePNaD).

See http://nlp.uned.es/IberEval-2017/index.php/Tasks/M-WePNaD for the task
page.

In this repository you will find a Jupyter Notebook with some sample code
to get you started. All we do so far is just take a first look at some of
the training queries.

## Install

You can use `conda` or `pip`. To see which Python packages were used,
check out the file `./environment.yml` in this repository.

One of the packages installed with `conda` was Jupyter Notebook. Run
it from the directory in which you have put this repository (so one
directory level above this repository).

Next to this repository, the Notebook assumes you will have a directory
`data`, with a directory structure like this:

```
data/training_data/GoldStandardTraining.txt
data/training_data/MWePNaDTraining
```

Get these two items from the organisers of the task.

That should get you up and running.

## Support

If you have pressing questions about the task, ask them at the mailing list
(Google Groups, group name: m-wepnad)!
